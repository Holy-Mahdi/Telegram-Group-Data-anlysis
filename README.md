# Telegram Group Data Analysis

This project performs data analysis on a Telegram group chat containing approximately 100,000 messages. The goal is to extract insights, generate statistics, and prepare the data for further analysis or visualization.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning** ✅

   * Removed unnecessary metadata and noise from the chat JSON.
   * Standardized text for analysis.

2. **Word Frequency Analysis** ✅

   * Generated `word_frequencies.csv` containing the frequency count of each word in the chat.

## Next Steps

* Perform sentiment analysis on messages.
* Visualize most common words using word clouds or bar charts.
* Identify active users and chat patterns.
* Explore temporal trends and message activity over time.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
3. Run the scripts for data cleaning and word frequency generation.

## Notes

* The dataset is anonymized to protect privacy.
* This analysis is for educational purposes.
